  "name": "Wine Cellar Labyrinth â€“ WC-A3 Run",
  "description": "Inspired by forum discussions about the nightmare maneuver through the tight brick archway WC-A3, this level starts the pilot at the cellar entrance, forces them past long rows of racks and through the infamous arch (checkpoint 1), then deeper into a light-starved alcove (checkpoint 2) before finally winding out through another constricted doorway to the hidden back room. Dim lighting, cool cellar air and gusty cross-drafts heighten the difficulty. Barrels and a half-collapsed wooden divider narrow the approach to the arch, while assorted mansion clutter provides plenty of collision hazards elsewhere.",
