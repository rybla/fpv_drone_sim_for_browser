  "name": "Wine Cellar Labyrinth – WC-A3 Run",
  "description": "Navigate a drone from the cellar stairwell, weave past the barrel racks, squeeze through the brutally narrow brick archway WC-A3, and reach the hidden alcove beyond. The level recreates the low-lit, stone-walled cellar complete with unpredictable drafts: a ceiling fan high above the stairwell produces momentary gusts that funnel down the passage, jostling the drone just as it threads the arch. Several old wine barrels tilt toward the flight path, and a half-collapsed wooden room divider sits precariously in one of the adjoining corridors—any hard bump ends the mission as the divider ‘destabilises the structure’. Extra clutter (tables, chairs, crates) makes every corner tight and sensor readings noisy.",
