    "name": "Grand Library Under-Table Retrieval",
    "description": "Inspired by the forum discussion on extreme close-quarters flight, this level puts the pilot in the Grand Library.  The route begins at the base of the main stairway, forces the drone up one flight to build confidence, then pushes it down a corridor into the dim Grand Library where an antique wooden reading table dominates the dark half of the light-and-dark chamber.  The operator must slip beneath that table, pass a fragile tube-radio sitting on the floor, and recover the intel marker located in the archway just beyond.  A single checkpoint on the stairway lets pilots reset before attempting the precision portion.  Numerous props—barrels, furniture, a whirring fan that stirs up dust, even a dangerously stored grenade crate—create believable clutter and subtle airflow disturbances throughout the mansion.",
