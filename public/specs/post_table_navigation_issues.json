    "name": "Grand Library Under-Table Skim",
    "description": "Inspired by the forum’s \"Grand Library\" discussion, this level recreates a dim, wood-paneled reading room dominated by an enormous antique wooden table.  The drone begins at the mansion’s main stairway, threads through ground-floor halls, then drops under the table to collect intel before escaping through a partially blocked exit.  Tight leg spacing, poor light, and a \"radio\" (represented by a floor fan) beside one table leg force ultra-precise manoeuvres.  Extra furniture, crates, and décor scattered throughout the mansion add optional slalom challenges while ensuring the environment feels lived-in and cluttered, and overhead turbulence (windEnabled) simulates down-wash in confined air.  The player must touch two checkpoints on the way to the objective under the table, then reach the far corner of the checker room to exfiltrate.",
