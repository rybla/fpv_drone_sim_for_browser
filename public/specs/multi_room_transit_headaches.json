    "description": "Pilot a micro-UAV from an over-exposed bathroom through a dim bedroom and into a cluttered dressing room to locate a simulated IED, then exfiltrate.  Lighting shifts, a reflective marble table, an active ceiling fan, and densely packed furniture reproduce the orientation, sensor, and control problems called out in the forum discussion.  Checkpoints force the operator to steady up in the bedroom before squeezing past the final doorway into the dressing room where the target sits.",
