    "name": "Grand Library Spiral Ascent",
    "description": "This level recreates the arduous climb up the Grand Libraryâ€™s narrow spiral staircase. The player launches at the very base, must hop over a metal barrel that blocks the first few steps, weave through a tightening spiral surrounded by book-lined walls, fight intermittent gusts from hidden ventilation fans, dodge a bulky mock fusion-reactor crate on an upper landing, squeeze past a wooden room divider jammed against the rail near the top, and finally burst out through the skylight into open air. Extra furniture litters adjacent rooms visible through archways, adding visual clutter and potential collision hazards while enriching the mansion ambience.",
