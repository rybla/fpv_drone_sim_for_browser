    "description": "A tight, three-room drone run that begins in a brightly-lit bathroom, pushes through a doorway into a dimmer bedroom with an operating ceiling fan, and finishes inside a cramped dressing room containing a toy TU-95 model and a wooden chair that guards the hidden device.  Pilots must cope with slick marble reflections, light-to-dark adaptation, fan-generated turbulence, and narrow doorframes while hitting all four progression beacons before reaching the device and reversing course.",
