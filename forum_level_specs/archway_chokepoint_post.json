    "name": "Wine Cellar Labyrinth – Archway Chokepoint WC-A3",
    "description": "Inspired by the user’s scenario, this level recreates a dim, cramped wine-cellar maze whose main trial is squeezing a drone through the brick archway WC-A3. The path starts deep in the rack aisles (long bottom room), forces the pilot to line up perfectly with the choke-point archway (mapped to the “archway into light and dark room of checker corner room”), and finishes in a hidden alcove beyond (dark side of light and dark room). Leaning wine barrels and an unstable wooden divider partially block the archway, and a ventilation fan hidden in the ceiling produces short, sideways gusts. Low lighting, increased network latency, and cooler cellar air complete the challenge. Touch every checkpoint in order to succeed; brushing either the barrels or divider triggers harsh collision physics, so absolute precision is required.",
