    "name": "Master Suite IED Scan",
    "description": "Fly a small recon-drone from the brightly lit master bathroom, skim low over a reflective marble table that scrambles the altimeter, slip through two successive doorways into an intentionally dimmer bedroom where a ceiling fanâ€™s down-wash pushes the drone off course, and finally thread the craft into a cramped, clutter-filled dressing room. Inside the dressing room, avoid clipping a toy TU-95 model aircraft sitting on a shelf just inside the door and a wooden chair tucked beneath a low vanity while completing your scan. Signal strength drops steadily as you penetrate deeper, so hit the two interior checkpoints quickly and then exfiltrate. Battery life, changing light levels, fan-generated turbulence, and tight clearances provide continuous pressure.",
