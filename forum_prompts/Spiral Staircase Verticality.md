**Spiral Staircase Verticality**

Alright team, who's tackled the "Grand Library" scenario and tried to ascend that monster spiral staircase? The descent was tricky enough, but going *up* it feels like fighting a tornado in a broom closet. My drone's altimeter was having a field day with the pressure changes, and maintaining a stable climb while also rotating to follow the curve was... an experience. Nearly became a permanent art installation on the mezzanine railing.

You're not kidding\! I managed it once, but it was ugly. The biggest issue for me was judging the clearance from the inner banister and the outer wall simultaneously. The fisheye lens effect on the camera feed doesn't help with those tight curves. I also had a near miss with a **Metal Barrel** that was inexplicably left at the base of the stairs, partially obstructing the initial entry point for the ascent. Had to do a very awkward hop to get over it before even starting the climb.

That spiral staircase is a true test of 3D piloting. My main challenge was the inconsistent updrafts, especially around the halfway point where the staircase narrows slightly. It felt like the drone was getting pushed outwards. I also noticed a **Portable Fusion Reactor** (simulated, obviously, but still a bulky obstacle\!) placed on a landing about three-quarters of the way up. Trying to maneuver around that while still climbing and turning required some serious stick-and-rudder skills. Lost visual on my exit point for a terrifying second.

Oh, I saw that **Portable Fusion Reactor** too\! What is that thing even doing in a library scenario? Talk about a random hazard. My drone's proximity sensors were screaming bloody murder as I squeezed past it. I was so focused on not hitting it, I almost didn't see the **Wooden Room Divider** that had been propped against the railing near the top, creating an even tighter final exit.

Operators, the spiral staircase ascent in "Grand Library" (GL-SA1) is indeed one of our more demanding vertical navigation challenges. It's designed to push your multi-axis control and situational awareness.

The placement of objects like the **Metal Barrel**, **Portable Fusion Reactor**, and the **Wooden Room Divider** are deliberate inclusions to break up any "easy lines" and force dynamic path adjustments. We're also testing the drone's stability control system with the simulated air currents within the stairwell.

Feedback regarding sensor performance and control responsiveness during these complex maneuvers is particularly useful.

Good to know the suffering is intentional, SimTester\_03\! Perhaps a predictive flight path overlay for spiral ascents could be a future HUD upgrade? Trying to anticipate the curve while managing altitude and avoiding random junk like that **Metal Barrel** is a lot to process.
