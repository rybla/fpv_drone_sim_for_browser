## **Grand Library \- Intel & Debriefs**

Hey everyone,

Just managed to slip through the Grand Library mission. Man, that place is something else. Has anyone else noticed how... *particular* the security is? It's like they're expecting someone, but not *everyone*.

I found the balcony door on the second floor was the easiest way in, just like the rumors said. Had a close call with one of those cleaning drones on the mezzanine – those things are surprisingly quiet on those wooden railings. Had to use those massive bookshelves as cover more than once.

The spiral staircase is a deathtrap if you're not careful. I opted for a controlled glide right down the center. Seemed safer than trying to sneak down the steps with those patrol patterns.

The "package" was right where intel suggested, on a lectern near that ridiculously oversized fireplace on the ground floor. Getting out was a bit of a fluke – one of the stained-glass windows had a small gap. Almost like it was left open... intentionally?

Anyone else get that vibe? Like the "rival collector" *wanted* someone to find this stuff, but only someone good enough?

ShadowStalker007, good to see you made it. I ran that op last week. Definitely agree on the "intentional" vibe. The whole setup felt less like a fortress and more like a... test.

My entry point was the same, that balcony door is practically an invitation if you know where to look. Those ornate railings are beautiful, but a nightmare for noise discipline. I nearly got spotted by an AI guard when I was trying to get a better view from the mezzanine. Those bookshelves are your best friend up there.

I didn't risk the glide down the staircase – too exposed for my liking. I took it slow and steady, timing the guard patrols. Found a neat little hiding spot under one of the big mahogany reading tables on the ground floor. Perfect for a quick breather and to get my bearings before heading into the stacks.

The sheer number of books is overwhelming. Took me a while to scan the titles, even with the target parameters. The lectern by the fireplace is almost too obvious, right?

And yeah, that "accidentally" open stained-glass window? No way that's a coincidence. This "rival collector" is playing a different game.

LOL, you guys are overthinking it. It's just a mission. Balcony, railings, staircase, table, books, fireplace, window. Done.

Tho, gotta admit, flying down the middle of that spiral staircase was pretty epic. Felt like a movie. Almost got zapped by a cleaning drone when I was hiding under the table though. Those things are annoying.

Found the folder on the stand thingy. The window was open. Easy peasy. Don't see what the big conspiracy is. He just sucks at security.

NoobSlayer\_1337, you miss the artistry\! The "rival collector" is clearly a connoisseur of theatrics.

Consider the architecture: a *Grand Library*. A repository of knowledge, of stories. The objective? "Sensitive documents." The pathway itself is a narrative.

* **The Ascent (or rather, Infiltration):** The slightly ajar balcony door – a subtle invitation, a chink in the armor.  
* **The Perilous Path:** Navigating the mezzanine, a high-stakes game of hide-and-seek amongst towering bastions of literature. The railings, ornate yet treacherous.  
* **The Descent:** The spiral staircase – a dramatic transition to the heart of the matter. Flying down its core is indeed a bold, almost performative act.  
* **The Hidden Search:** Weaving under tables, through rows of silent sentinels (bookshelves), each spine a potential secret.  
* **The Revelation:** The target on a lectern, a place of presentation, near a fireplace, a symbol of warmth, knowledge, or perhaps, destruction.  
* **The Enigmatic Exit:** The stained-glass window, a beautiful yet fragile barrier, conveniently compromised.

This isn't just about lax security. It's a message. Each element is chosen. The "rival collector" isn't just an antagonist; they're a curator of conflict. Mark my words, there's a deeper meaning to the choice of location and the breadcrumbs left for us.

Can we talk about those cleaning drones for a sec? Are they repurposed security bots, or did the "rival collector" just get a bulk deal on Roombas with tasers? Seriously, one of them almost cornered me between the bookshelves on the ground floor. Had to do a combat roll under a reading table that would have made my drill instructor proud.

Agree with ShadowStalker007 and EagleEye\_Actual, the whole thing felt staged. That open window was way too convenient.
