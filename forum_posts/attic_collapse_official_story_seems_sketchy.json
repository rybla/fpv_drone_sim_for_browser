    "body": "Anyone else raise an eyebrow at the briefing for the \"Attic\" op? \"Minor tremor\" or \"neglect\"? Come on. That place looked like a controlled demolition went sideways. And sending us in with high-spec drones for a \"family heirloom\"? Smells fishy. My thermal picked up some weird readings around that so-called heirloom, too. Not just metallic warmth. Felt… active.\n\nMy guess? That \"heirloom\" was something they *really* didn't want anyone else finding, and the collapse was just convenient cover. Or maybe not so convenient for whoever was supposed to be living there.\n\nJust saying, keep your optics peeled. This whole \"retrieval\" felt more like evidence tampering.",

The thermal signature on that \"heirloom\" was definitely off. Standard procedure for metallic objects in a cold environment would show a clear, passive heat differential. This was… pulsed. Almost like a beacon, but faint. And navigating that mess? The intel said \"cluttered,\" not \"death trap waiting to happen.\" Those beams weren't just sagging; they were splintered like something *hit* them.\n\nThe whole \"hole in the roof\" entry point felt way too convenient too. Like it was made for us."

I swear, I was easing through that gap, dust everywhere, and the whole thing shifted. Heart-in-my-throat moment.\n\nThe thermal was a lifesaver for spotting the target, though. Trying to find a small box in that junk pile with visual only would have taken all day. The path out was definitely trickier than going in. Had to double back twice. Anyone find a clean exit route on their first try?\n\nAlso, did anyone else spot those creepy old dolls in one of the crushed boxes? Gave me the chills."

That whole section under the sagging roof felt like it was going to come down any second. Precision flying was key. My advice for anyone attempting this: slow and steady. Don't rush it. Use your drone's smallest profile if you can adjust.\n\nThe \"heirloom\" itself... yeah, \"valuable antique\" my left foot. Looked more like a piece of comms gear, or something that *used* to be. The dust and decay in that place were intense. You could almost smell it through the remote feed. Makes you wonder what stories those old houses hold."

            "body": "Alright, hear me out. The \"tremor\" was a cover-up. The \"neglect\" is a lie. That attic wasn't just old; it was *disturbed*. The way those beams were shattered? That wasn't natural decay.\n\nAnd the \"heirloom\"? With a *heat signature*? In a cold attic? Unless it was radioactive (which, hey, possible), that means it was generating its own heat. My theory: it's not from around here. They sent us in because our drone tech is deniable if things go south. We're retrieving something they don't want public, something that might have *caused* the collapse.\n\nThink about it: the narrow entry, the unstable environment... it's all designed to keep casual observers out. But a small, agile drone? Perfect. We're the deniable asset retrieving the unexplainable. Mark my words, this \"heirloom\" is going to show up later in a much bigger way."
