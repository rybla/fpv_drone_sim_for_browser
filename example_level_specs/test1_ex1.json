    "name": "Frostbite Passage",
    "description": "A dimly lit, draft-ridden winter scenario set across two adjoining rooms.  Sparse lamps and the glow of a TV are the only light sources, forcing players to rely on the flashlight found early in the route.  A cold current sneaks in through the cracked window in Room B and is amplified by a fan, creating occasional turbulence that nudges the drone off course.  The course begins in total darkness beneath a table, climbs onto the tabletop strewn with a toy airplane, dives through a glowing obstacle ring in the doorway, and weaves past a sofa before finishing at the icy window ledge.  Snow can be seen swirling outside, and faint howling wind audio reinforces the frigid, low-light atmosphere.",
