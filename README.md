## Notes

- requiremnts:
  - use three-js for 3D rendering
  - import environments and 3D models
  - physics:
    - gravity
    - wind
    - propulsion
    - collisions
      - this will be hard, definitely need a physics engine to handle this

- stuff to simulate:
  - temperature
  - battery levels
  - air speed
  - propeller speed
  - controls
    - mode 2
    - layout
    - how affects specific motors
  - first-person view from front of drone
